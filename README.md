## Setting up environment
### Create new virtual environment with venv
- run `python -m venv ./pierre-back-env`
- If running on powershell: run `./pierre-back-env/scripts/activate.ps1`
- If running on cmd: run `./pierre-back-env/scripts/activate.bat`

### Installing dependencies
Make sure you have already activated your virtual environment
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Starting the server
Make sure you are in a powershell/cmd window with the virtual environment activated
- run `python ./main.py`
